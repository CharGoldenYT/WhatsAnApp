# WhatsAnApp
WhatsAnApp (Also known as What's an app?) is a UI modification to WhatsApp's Shitty UI and Removing unwanted features.

WhatsAnApp is a UI modification. Not a full modification for WhatsApp. We're not trying to get our ass sued by Meta.

---

WhatsAnApp is a python project based app using Flask and PyWebView. Making it easier yet having more control without fucking around and fetching their API and getting our ass sued.

We believe that we deserve a Better UI than whatever the fuck they made. Going all in with the UI change.

---

If you want us to add modification (message logs, read receips and such) to WhatsApp web, we're not doing it.

We're not risking a cease and desist letter from Meta, the parent company of WhatsApp.

Please note that if you want modification, do it yourself or ask someone to do it. Not the official devs of `WhatsAnApp`. If you do make modifications, be VERY aware that you have a high chance of getting a cease and desist from Meta.
